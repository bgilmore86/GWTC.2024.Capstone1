Here I attemped to build a simple but effective traveler application for travel-loving consumers to go to purchase items at a travel company's gift shop essentially. They are also able to browse some hot-spot locations for travel. For example, the application can be built up with more pages and functionality like booking flights or tours; along with cars and hotel reservations, creating a posting database where users can send reviews, or comments on products, or even selling custom products themselves, and so on; something like a travel liason.

Presentation: Notes:

Home Page: This is the beginning page where the user will find all the links included in the application as well as be able to navigate to each component and page individually through the use of a navigation bar with links established.

Travel Page: This page will show the user famous global attractions from around the world to travel to, with their locations. I was able to download a library to use formatting for a set of images to become a carousel and basically spin by the control of the user and arrows.

Store: This page will request login upon arrival and show the user products from the associated travel company's gift shop. Once authenticated with username and password, the products will show; if the username or password is incorrect, an alert will display as a pop up on the screen that it was an invalid entry and to try again.

Cart: This is where I attempted to fetch the FakeStoreAPi endpoint '/carts/3' for user#3 cart; however, unable to finish; this page will show a dummy render of a product in "cart page" with associated buttons, to simulate api cart received data.

Contact: This link will take the user to the About Page of the company's app, and will contain contacting details.

Checkout: This is the page once selecting checkout in the cart page that the user will complete their shopping; containing card processing functionality, eventually, and have a farewell as well.

Enjoy!!
