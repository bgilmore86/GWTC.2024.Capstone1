Here I attemped to build a simple but effective traveler application for travel-loving consumers go to purchase items at a travel company's gift shop essentially; as well as searching for locations for travel. For example the application can be built up with more pages and functionality like booking flights or tours, creating a posting database where users can send reviews comment on products or selling custom products and so on.

Presentation: Notes:
I did something a little bit different and more involved by creating a mock application which includes an ecommerce-type store with some data, like images and product details, which is received from libraries of code as well as pieces for features built on different pages of my app.

Home Page:
This is the beginning stage of the user to find all the links included in the app as well as navigate to each component and page individually through the use of a navigation bar and links established within the main application page to go to each page.

Travel Page:
This page will show the user famous global attractions from around the world to travel to with their locations.

Store:
This page will request login upon arrival and show the user products from travel gift shop once authenticated with username and password; if the username or password is incorrect, an alert will display as a pop up on the screen.

Cart:
This is where I attempted to fetch the FakeStoreAPi endpoint 'carts/3'; however, unable to finish; this page will show a dummy render of a product in cart with associated buttons to simulate api cart fetched data; wasn't able to get running completely.

Contact:
This link will take the user to the About Page and will contain details about said company and contact details.

Checkout:
This is the page the user will get to once complete with their shopping, containing card processing functionality and be a farewell page as well.

Enjoy!
